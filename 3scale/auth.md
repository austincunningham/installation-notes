# Auth

* 3Scale ships with it's own authn/authz mechanism
* It can be configured to [use RHSSO/Keycloak](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale/2.2/html-single/developer_portal/#enabling_and_disabling_authentication_via_red_hat_single_sign_on)
* A ServiceAccount OAuthClient is *NOT* used by 3Scale
