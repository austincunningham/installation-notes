# Guide

* Template based install: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale/2.2/html-single/infrastructure/#onpremises-installation

## Requirements

* `ReadWriteMany` volumes available.

## Install

Pull the `amp.yml` template.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3scale/3scale-amp-openshift-templates/master/amp/amp.yml > apb.yml
```

Create the resources in the template, providing the routing suffix of the cluster
as the `WILDCARD_DOMAIN`.

```bash
oc new-app -f amp.yml --param WILDCARD_DOMAIN=192.168.0.73.nip.io
```

An output similar to the following will be printed.

```bash
